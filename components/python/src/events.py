Voice Agent Event Types

Python implementation of the voice agent event system.
All events in the pipeline share common properties to enable
consistent handling, logging, and debugging across the system.

This module defines typed dataclasses for all events that flow through
the voice agent pipeline, from user audio input through STT, agent
processing, and TTS output.
